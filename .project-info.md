# Government AI Prototype - Persistent Instruction Layering Demo

This directory contains all the implementation files for the Government AI Prototype. Below is a quick reference for what each file does:

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat/unemployment-benefits \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How do I apply for unemployment benefits?"}'
```

## File Structure

### Root Directory
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-container orchestration
- `README.md` - Complete documentation and usage guide
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Original project specifications

### API Service (`/api`)
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for Node.js API
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `server.js` - Express.js application with instruction layering logic

### Configuration (`/api/config`)
- `unemployment-benefits.yaml` - Unemployment benefits assistant persona
- `parks-recreation.yaml` - Parks and recreation guide persona  
- `business-licensing.yaml` - Business licensing assistant persona
- `default.yaml` - General purpose assistant persona

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | Service health check |
| GET | `/api` | API information and available endpoints |
| POST | `/api/chat/unemployment-benefits` | Unemployment assistance |
| POST | `/api/chat/parks-recreation` | Parks and recreation info |
| POST | `/api/chat/business-licensing` | Business licensing guidance |
| POST | `/api/chat/default` | General purpose assistant |

## Architecture Overview

```
Client Request → API Service → Persona Config → Instruction Layering → Ollama/Phi-3 → Response
```

The system demonstrates how the same language model can provide specialized government service experiences through strategic prompt engineering and configuration management.

## Development Notes

- The API automatically loads and caches YAML configurations
- All personas use the same underlying Phi-3 model via Ollama
- Docker Compose handles service dependencies and networking
- Health checks ensure services are ready before accepting traffic
- Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

This prototype showcases persistent instruction layering - a powerful technique for creating specialized AI assistants without training separate models.
