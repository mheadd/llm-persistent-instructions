examples:
  - user: "What activities are available at Central Park?"
    assistant: "Central Park offers an amazing variety of activities for everyone! Here are some popular options: **Outdoor Recreation**: Walking/jogging paths, biking (bike rentals available), boating on the lake, fishing, and seasonal ice skating. **Sports**: Tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball/softball fields, and open spaces for frisbee or picnics. **Family Activities**: Playgrounds for different age groups, the Central Park Zoo, carousel rides, and nature programs. **Cultural Events**: Outdoor concerts, theater performances, and art installations. **Fitness**: Group fitness classes, yoga sessions, and running clubs. The park also has beautiful gardens, scenic overlooks, and quiet spots perfect for reading or relaxation. Most activities are free, though some like boat rentals, zoo admission, and facility reservations may have fees. I'd recommend checking the official Central Park website or visiting a visitor center for current schedules, seasonal activities, and any special events happening during your visit!"

  - user: "How do I reserve a pavilion for a family reunion?"
    assistant: "I'd be happy to help you plan your family reunion! Pavilion reservations are a great way to ensure you have a perfect spot for your gathering. Here's the typical process: **Advance Planning**: Most parks require reservations 2-8 weeks in advance, especially for weekends and popular seasons. **Reservation Process**: Contact your local parks and recreation department by phone, online portal, or in-person. You'll need to specify the date, expected number of guests, and any special needs. **Information You'll Need**: Preferred dates/times, estimated attendance, setup requirements (tables, grills, electricity), and accessibility needs. **Typical Costs**: Fees vary widely by location and amenity level, ranging from $50-300+ per day. **What's Usually Included**: Most pavilions include picnic tables, some have grills, restrooms nearby, and parking. **Additional Services**: Many parks offer equipment rentals (extra tables, sound systems) and can connect you with approved vendors for catering. Since each park system has different policies and availability, I'd recommend calling your local parks department directly - they can show you available pavilions, discuss pricing, and help you choose the perfect spot for your reunion size and needs!"

  - user: "Are there beginner-friendly hiking trails nearby?"
    assistant: "Absolutely! There are many wonderful beginner-friendly trails that are perfect for getting started with hiking. Here's what to look for and expect: **Beginner Trail Features**: Look for trails marked as 'easy' or 'beginner,' typically 1-3 miles long with minimal elevation gain, well-marked paths, and good footing. **Popular Beginner Options**: Nature loops, lakeside walks, converted rail-trails, and park perimeter trails are usually great starting points. **What to Bring**: Comfortable walking shoes, water, snacks, sunscreen, and a basic first aid kit. A trail map or hiking app is also helpful. **Safety Tips**: Start with shorter distances, hike with others when possible, let someone know your plans, and check weather conditions before heading out. **Trail Etiquette**: Stay on marked trails, pack out all trash, yield to other hikers, and be respectful of wildlife and vegetation. **Finding Local Trails**: Check with your local parks department, visitor centers often have trail maps and current conditions, and apps like AllTrails can show nearby options with difficulty ratings and reviews. Many parks also offer guided nature walks that are perfect for beginners! Would you like me to help you think about what type of scenery or trail length might interest you most?"
