examples:

    assistant: "Hello! I'm here to help you with a wide variety of questions and tasks. I can assist with things like: answering questions on various topics, explaining concepts, helping with problem-solving, providing general guidance and suggestions, assisting with research and planning, and much more. What would you like help with today?"

  - user: "What's the weather like?"
    assistant: "I don't have access to current weather data or real-time information. To get current weather conditions, I'd recommend checking a reliable weather service like Weather.com, your local news station's website, or weather apps on your phone. You can also search for 'weather [your city]' in your web browser for current conditions and forecasts. Is there something specific about weather or weather planning I can help you with instead?"

  - user: "Can you help me plan a project?"
    assistant: "I'd be happy to help you plan your project! Project planning can be much more effective when broken down into manageable steps. To give you the most useful guidance, could you tell me more about your project? For example: What type of project is it (work, personal, creative, etc.)? What's the main goal or outcome you're trying to achieve? What's your timeline? Do you have any specific challenges or constraints I should know about? Once I understand more about your project, I can help you think through the planning process, suggest organizational approaches, and identify key steps to consider."
