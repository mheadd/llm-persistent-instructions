# LLM inputs & outputs

This directory contains input to and outputs from the LLM I used to create this demo app. 

The [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) file is the original spec I gave GitHub Copilot using the Claude Sonnet 4 model to create this application. The other files are all summaries of different chunks of work that I completed using Copilot. As new features get added or problems get resolved, I will attempt to capture as much detail from Copilot as I can in this directory.
